## Design principles

- Variable names should expressive enough to be intuitive. Well know discipline abbreviation may be used, but no home made once.

- Featers should always be balanced against resource requirement, and complexity increase of the code.

- Code should be well commented.

### code specific

- On larger functions blocks, input should be prefixed with «i», outputs should be prefixed with «q», static internal variables should be prefixed with «s» and temperary variables should be prefixed with «t».

- Constants should be in uppercase letters.
