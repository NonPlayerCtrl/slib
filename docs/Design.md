## Design principles

- Variable names should be expressive enough to be intuitive indicate the function. Well know discipline abbreviation may be used, but no home made once.

- Featers should always be balanced against resource requirement, and complexity increase of the code.

- Backward compatibility should be keeped.

- Code should be well commented.


### Code specific guidelines

- On larger functions blocks, input should be prefixed with «i», outputs should be prefixed with «q», static internal variables should be prefixed with «s» and temperary variables should be prefixed with «t». This guideline doesn't need to be enforced on samler function blocks.

- Constants should be in uppercase letters.
